  h2 Quality is everything you do, that you strictly don't need to do, but the wise one strictly does do.
  div These pages will provide guides to best practice in the quality space.
  div The drivers for quality initiatives are:

  ul
    li independent progress
    li of high quality software
    li delivered in a timely fashion
    li a cost effective manner
    li A key target is to, not only minimise bugs escaping into production, but also to minimise bugs escaping into sprint testing

  di Quality will impact all aspects of the SDLC including; architecture, process, feature development, testing, release, and support.
