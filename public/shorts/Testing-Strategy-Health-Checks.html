<h1>Testing the Test Strategy</h1>

Test Strategies are traditionally expressed in a generalised form. These die an early death, unread, neglected, lost in an ocean of project documentation. 
<br>
Why? because they have no relevance, are abstract, have no commitment associated. The process of defining them is vague; who writes it, what does it contain, do we even need it. 

<h3>Testing implementations vary by numerous factors :</h3>
<ul>
<li>Front end apps</li>
<li> Back end APIs</li>
<li> Native mobile app</li>
<li> Web monolith</li>
<li> Third party supplier </li>
<li> Team resources </li>
<li> Disposition to risk</li>
<li> Architecture</li>
<li> New or legacy</li>
<li> Ease of fallback</li>
</ul>

Eg. For some, time to market is king, so streamlined testing with easy fallback and testing in production is an approach. For a financial or health application, testing will be significantly risk averse and so will favour much more oversight. 
<br><br>
Drawing from a generic best practice template, we should build individual project quality health checks that define the particular approach measured against best practice. 
Where a gap exists, remedial actions should be defined. 
The health check should inclue; 
<ul>
<li>sit in same code repository, </li>
<li>be agreed by the team, </li>
<li>be maintained by the QA, </li>
<li>and adhoc audits should be run to check its veracity, rendering it a testable artifact. </li>
</ul>
