  <h1>Exploratory Testing</h1>

<h2>Happy / sad path</h2>
Key use cases by Acceptance Criteria

<h2>Known gotchas</h2>

JS turned off on browser, 
Back button impact, 
Multi tab browser, 
Cookie content exposure, 
Caching issues, 
Clearing cache manually, 
Web mobile, 
Redirection from 3rd party APIs, 
No default sort order in list, 
Data migration, 
Bookmark direct page (eg. ignore login), 
Options http method, 
Double click, 
Fallback and recovery, 
Model based test - go in wrong order directly, 
Leading zeroes, blanks, null, html entry, decimal, real number, 
Very large text, 
HTML characters in the input

<h2>Boundary analysis</h2>

Check boundary conditions in code and tests

E.g if pass mark is a percentage between 0 and 100, then test with; -1, 0,100, 101, >max number

<h2>Equivalence partitioning</h2>
Check boundary conditions in code and tests around key values

E.g if pass mark = 75% then test with 74,75,76

<h2>Model based</h2>
Define a model of your application and infer valid and invalid journey

E.g. Create a logical state machine, and traverse

<h2>Grey box / test the architecture</h2>
Analyse the architecture and test Integration errors e.g. 3rd party service being down

<h2>Persona</h2>
Understand the different types of Users and test each one

E.g. content editor, editorial manager, legal

<h2>Third Party - Independent Mindset</h2>
Get others, with a different mindset, to test,

e.g. ‘bug bash’ with all team, work floor

<h2>Dog food</h2>
Incoroprate the Dev app in your daily work

E.g. Use Content Creation to write tech docs for the release

<h2>Behavioural</h2>
Write the tests as customer behaviours 

e.g. ‘if I enter a invalid password then i get a 500 http error’

could be re-written as

‘If i enter an invalid password then i can’t login’

<h2>Probabilistic</h2>
If definitive results cannot be derived from a single scenario, consider many passes and asserting against a threshold.

E.g. Application should predict your car from your post code. Call the app many times and assert that sufficient correct results were obtained.
