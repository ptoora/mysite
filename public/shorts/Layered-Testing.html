<h1>Parsh's Testing Wiki - 'Going to the FLICS' - a simple approach to efficient testing</h1>

<h2>For every component (service or front-end) in your architecture, consider applying a FLICS testing approach:</h2>

<b>F</b>  =  functional testing with 3rd parties stubbed
<br>
<b>L</b>   =  local state testing, component chains in your domain, with 3rd parties stubbed
<br>
<b>I</b>   =   integration testing with real 3rd party clients (run a small subset of  functional)
<br>
<b>C</b>   =  consumer testing initiated (run a small set of their functional)
<br>
<b>S</b>   =  system state testing, component chains across domains, with real third parties (smallest set)
<br>
<br>
<i>P.S. Don't forget; Performance, Security, SEO and Accessibility</i>
