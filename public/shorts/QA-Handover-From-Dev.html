    <h1>Parsh's Testing Wiki - QA Handover From Dev</h1>

    <h2>Before accepting a Story for exploratory testing, QAs should check the following 4 things as part of a handover from Dev:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
  <li>a demo that the Story ACs have been met</li>
<li>where the Dev has built the integration tests, we check there is sufficient test coverage</li>
<li>where the QA is building the integration tests , we check that the app is testable and that all AC assertions can be automated (useful IDs and classes in HTML, external dependencies can be injected etc)</li>
<li>scheck that; performance, security, SEO, and logging testability (devops) have been addressed</li>
</ul>
