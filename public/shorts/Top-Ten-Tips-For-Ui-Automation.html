<h1>Top 10 Tips For UI Test Automation</h1>

<h2>
<ol>
    <li>Implement 3 layers of abstraction; the test, the page object, and the browser/device driver. This supports DRY and allows you to switch driver. </li>
    <li>Make use of a BDD tool so that tests are readable and focused on Behaviour. The Page Objects should expose a DSL.</li>
    <li>Run your application with stubbed APIs so that tests are fast and determinstic. The full regression suite (on one browser) should be fast enough to run as part of CI.</li>
    <li>Ensure assertions are expressed in tests and not in framework so that failures are easy to investigate and expectations are visible. </li>
    <li>Build a lightweight framework so that adding tests is easy. </li>
    <li>Choose a language that Devs are comfortable with so that they can collaborate. </li>
    <li>House the tests in the same repo and branch as the feature, so Testability is baked-in. </li>
    <li>Use stable and simple locators (css, xpath etc) , ensuring that Devs build applications in support of this. </li>
    <li>Avoid flakiness. Before performing your interaction, check elements are; present, visible, in-focus, and clickable with a wait condition. Ask Devs to build a class on the page to indicate if events have completed and have your tests wait on this.</li>
    <li>Pick test frameworks that support parallel running and cross browser testing.</li>
</ol>
