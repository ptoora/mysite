    <h1>Parsh's Testing Wiki - Definition Of ready</h1>

    <h3>The 'Defintion Of Ready' describes the prerequisites for a Story being played. It is as important, if not more, than the Defintion Of Ready.</h2>
    <h3>Before a story is picked-up for development, the following should be in place:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>a set of comprehesive Acceptance Criteria reviewed by; the QA, the Dev, and the Business</li>
        <li>a small sized story that is realistically deliverable into Prod by the end of the Sprint</li>
        <li>consideration given to; performance, security, seo, devops (logging), data analytics, accessibility, and testability</li>
    </ul>
