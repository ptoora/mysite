<h1>Parsh's Testing Wiki - Quality Metrics</h1>


<p>The purpose of quality metrics is to provide a trigger for revisiting the SDLC to explore potential weaknesses.

Quality is about; defects, timeliness, and cost effectiveness</p>

<ul>


<li>Urgent bugs escaping into production => review => Root cause analysis meetings (PM, Dev, QA)</li>
<li>Non-urgent bugs escaping into production => review =>  QA to track and decide best forum </li>
<li>Bugs escaping into exploratory testing	 => review => QA to track and decide best forum</li>
<li>CI run time from CI code checkout to completion of automated tests.	 => review => 	Aim to fail build if practical and a raise story to fix and relax the limit temporarily</li>
<li>Code coverage - unit (code robustness)	 => review => Fail the build (particularly for new code)</li>
<li>Code coverage - functional test (sufficient automation)	=> review => Fail the build (particularly for new code)</li>
<li>Cycle time from story played to story ready for prod Jira</li>
<li>Time to recovery  => review => fallback Testing	</li>
</ul>
