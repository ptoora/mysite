<h1>Parsh's Testing Wiki - Quality Metrics</h1>


<p>The purpose of quality metrics is to provide a trigger for revisiting the SDLC to explore potential weaknesses.

Quality is about; defects, timeliness, and cost effectiveness</p>

<h2>Headline Metrics</h2>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Count of bugs that reached Production</td>
            <td>Measure the quality of exploratory testing and coverage of regression tests</td>
            <td>May need to review the time alloted to exploraory testing, and review the techniques employed, and the test coverage</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Count of bugs that reached exploratry testing</td>
            <td>Measure of the quality of the acceptance criteria and their coverage in the automated tests.</td>
            <td>May need to improve Story refinement and/or the test automation review process</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Cycle Time - time from story pick-up to story ready-for-release</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Time To Recovery - time needed to fallback</td>
