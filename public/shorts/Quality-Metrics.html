<h1>Parsh's Testing Wiki - Quality Metrics</h1>


<p>The purpose of quality metrics is to provide a trigger for revisiting the SDLC to explore potential weaknesses.

Quality is about; defects, timeliness, and cost effectiveness</p>

<ul>


<li><b>Urgent bugs escaping into production </b> Review => Root cause analysis meetings (PM, Dev, QA)</li>
<li><b>Non urgent bugs escaping into production </b> Review =>  QA to track and decide best forum </li>
<li><b>Bugs escaping into exploratory testing</b> Review => QA to track and decide best forum</li>
<li><b>CI run time from CI code checkout to completion of automated tests.	</b>  Review => 	Aim to fail build if practical and a raise story to fix and relax the limit temporarily</li>
<li><b>Code coverage - unit (code robustness)	</b>  Review => Fail the build (particularly for new code)</li>
<li><b>Code coverage - functional test (sufficient automation)	</b> Review => Fail the build (particularly for new code)</li>
<li><b>Cycle time from story played to story ready for prod Jira</b> </li>
<li><b>Time to recovery  </b> Review => fallback Testing	</li>
</ul>
