<h1>The Magic and Mystery of Manual Exploratory Testing</h1>


<h3>There is no magic nor mystery about Exploratory Testing, it can only logically cover 3 areas:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tests that need more time and thought to conjure up</li>
<li>Tests that you couldn't automate</li>
<li>Tests that you didn't want to automate</li>
</ul>

The magic and mystery is not the test, but the tester.
