<h1>Parsh's Testing Wiki - Do We Need QAs In Agile?</h1>
<br>
<h2 style='text-decoration: underline;text-align:center'>YES and NO</h2>
<br>
<h3>What does a QA bring to the table:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A Question Asker, challenges assumptions, highlights ambiguity and anomalies, clarifies scope.</li>
    <li>A focus on the detail and not just the 'big picture', along with a focus on behaviour rather than technology</li>
    <li>Scenario generating machine, ideal for Story Refinement sessions</li>
    <li>Bug finder extraordinaire, drawing on instinct, suspicion, and experience</li>
    <li>Testing tools expertise eg, automation, investigation, simulation etcetera</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>But they also come at a cost:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>An extra team resource to hire, particularly as good QAs are a scarce resource</li>
    <li>Can become a process bottlekneck</li>
    <li>Can encourage a decoupling of Quality from the SDLC</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>So when should you definitely get a QA:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a medium-high risk / medium-high impact application (eg. health, finance, government)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A weak agile process, or a process that is honoured more in the breach than the observation</p>
<br>
<h3>So when should you think twice before getting a dedicated QA:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a low-medium risk / low-medium impact application and can tolerate some regressions</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong agile process supported by the guiding hand of a Scrum Master</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can fallback releases quickly</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nb. Not having a dedicated QA doesn't mean that we don't Exploratory Test. An independent team member should take on this important task.</p>
<br>

<p>What is a strong Agile process... in brief, one that has; a solid Definition of Ready and Done, easy collaboration, lane discipline, shift-left mentality etc is a good starting point.</p>
<br>
<p>Understanding your exposure to risk and impact, and the strength of your agile culture should guide you to the useful assesment.</p>
